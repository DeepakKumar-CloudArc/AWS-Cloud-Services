Make sure openssl version is 1.1.1

Run rake task to generate a new certificate:

bundle exec rake generate_project_certificates:do -- '--project_name=PROJECT_NAME'

Recommended certificate attributes:

C (Country): US
ST (State): California
L (Locality): San Francisco
O (Organization): Radian
OU (Organizational Unit): Lens
CN (Common Name): Radian
EMAIL (Email Address): eric.baller@radiangen.com

Then send a request to OPCUA server with the newly created certificate which can be done with another rake task:

bundle exec rake send_query_to_opcua_server:do -- '--project_name=PROJECT_NAME'

The newly created certificate has now been sent to OPCUA server. Please, ask a contact person to move the certificate from Rejected to Trusted folder on their server.

Once that done, it is needed to set is_registered flag to true for the certificate on certificates table. From now on, this certificate will be used when sending requests to OPCUA server.
